                                    <li>In general, you can visit IZOE on the World Wide Web without telling us who you
                                        are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web servers collect the
                                        domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is
                                        aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site,
                                        pages viewed, etc. TCPL uses this information to measure the use of our site and

                                    <li>Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to

                                        information. Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses, of those who
                                        provide information, available to other reputable organizations whose products
