<p><strong>Its definitely not easy to run the
business &#8211; </strong></p>



<p>Running a business is a multi tasking job. Business
owners have to pay attention in each and every department and monitor and
control the activities to get the desired output. </p>



<p>Now imagine manually handling all of
the data available in a non-consolidated format in physical files. It seems so overwhelming
even to think about.</p>



<p>But we are fortunate enough to have
computers so we do not have to deal with physical files for data anymore. Data
in non-consolidated format is still a problem as a lot of time will be spent
first creating a consolidated summary of the data and then analysing it.</p>



<p>To take away this burden from the business owners, <a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">Tally. ERP 9 software </a>has some amazing reports that suit almost every business type. These reports will help you to measure, analyze and implement control measures if needed.</p>



<p>Tally
Reporting System &#8211;</p>



<p><strong>Balance sheet</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<strong>balance
sheet</strong>&nbsp;is a financial statement that reports a company&#8217;s assets,
liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity at a specific point in time, and provides
a basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It shows the financial stability and the performance of the company.</p>



<p><strong>Profit and
loss </strong></p>



<p>Display&nbsp;<strong>Profit</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Loss Account</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Profit
and Loss Account</strong>&nbsp;or Income&nbsp;<strong>Statement</strong>&nbsp;is a
periodic&nbsp;<strong>statement</strong>, which shows the net result of business
operations for a specified period. The&nbsp;<strong>profit and loss account in Tally</strong>.
ERP 9 displays the information based on the default primary groups.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase
register</strong></p>



<p>A purchase register shows a summary
of all the purchases made by the company at a specific period. You can check
for errors or duplicate entries that may generate a false image of the company.</p>



<p><strong>Sales register</strong></p>



<p>A sales register just like the
purchase register shows a summary of all the sales done at a specific period of
time. This helps you to keep a check on the movement of goods out of the
organization. You can get insights about your best sold products.</p>



<p><strong>Stock summary
report</strong></p>



<p>You can check the present condition
of the stock. This helps to understand how to optimally reorder stock without
wasting it. And avoid over-stocking of inventory or under-stocking.</p>



<p><strong>Ratio Analysis</strong></p>



<p>A ratio analysis report is an amazing
tool to understand the financial standing of the company. The different ratios
give a clear understanding of the financial health of the company. Various
ratios like debt-equity ratio, quick ratio, return on working capital, etc. are
available in Tally.</p>



<p>All of this data is considered highly
confidential and you would never want an outsider to get a hold over it and
thus it is important to hide certain data or ensure there is some security in
place for your Tally data.</p>



<p><strong>Security And Control
Features In Tally &#8211;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tally Vault</strong></p>



<p>Tally has a feature of Tally vault.
That keeps data encrypted. Only when you enter a password, the data is
accessible. With the help of this feature, you can ensure your data is not
being accessed by any unauthorized person.</p>



<p><strong>Hide data path</strong></p>



<p>Data path is where your Tally data is
saved. In default Tally, your data path is visible to the user. Some businesses
may see this as a threat to their data and may want to hide the location of
their data. In such businesses, Tally Server 9 can be used to get higher levels
of security.</p>



<p><strong>Data entry
report and log</strong></p>



<p>You can monitor your employeeâ€™s
activity using this feature. And ensure efficiency in work is maintained. The
more you are aware of the day to day activities of your employees the more you
will be able to execute control measures to improve their performance.</p>



<p>These are some very important
features in Tally that you, as a business owner must be aware of. You can now
access your Tally data in graphical format using your Smart phone through Biz
Eye Business Dashboard.</p>
