<p>Why is GST such a game-changer here? There are ample benefits a business
stands to get out of computerised accounts, but GST seems to have added a whole
new set of reasons, all by itself. Let’s explore why computerised accounts has
become all the more important, since it can help your business for being
compliant under GST:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Compliance      no longer based on summary, but based on transactions</strong>&nbsp;– In the previous      indirect tax regime, the return filling used to be based on summary level      information i.e. on the total of all transactions in a given financial      period. In the GST regime, each transaction will need to be uploaded on      the GST portal, and via a set of 3 returns, every tax payer will get to      know about his tax liability and the available input tax credit he can      utilise to meet it. Given the multiple suppliers and customers, managing      compliance at this level is next to impossible using manual accounting.      Maintaining computerised accounts will not only allow for accurate book      keeping, but also allow quick detection of errors, and a comprehensive      compliance experience which can ensure the right ITC for businesses.</li><li><strong>Dependency      on supplier for the right ITC</strong>&nbsp;– In the previous indirect tax regime,      there was no inter-dependency amongst businesses as far as compliance was      concerned. In the current regime, the allotment of ITC on provisional      basis and consequently on a final basis is dependent on the suppliers of a      business. Only if the supplier files his returns properly and pays the      requisite tax against those returns, will a business avail the right ITC.      There are bound to be situations, where there may be disputes, missing      invoices etc. and that can only be resolved via a robust system of online      matching of bills. Both pre and post matching, businesses will need to      check their books for any errors or non-compliant transactions, and      correct potential errors. In order to communicate with one’s suppliers and      customers with the right data, maintaining computerised accounts is a      must. Manual accounting will surely make the process longer and tedious,      which may result in loss of ITC and negatively impact working capital.</li><li><strong>Revised      ITC provisions</strong>&nbsp;–      Unlike the previous regime, there are a lot of scenarios, in which a business      can avail ITC. One most important example is the ability to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">avail ITC&nbsp;</a>on indirect expenses,      which has been introduced in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">GST regime</a>, as part of the      “furtherance of business”. Similarly, subject to provisions, businesses      are allowed to carry over transitional ITC from the previous regime, ITC      on capital goods and so on. Only if a business maintains accurate records,      will it be able to file the returns correctly, which will lead to the      right ITC being allocated. It is therefore no surprise, that computerised      accounts will be much more useful compared to manual accounts is      concerned, as it will allow for the right records to be fetched, quickly      and efficiently.</li><li><strong>Increased      compliance activity</strong>&nbsp;– For any regular trader, 1 monthly return and 1 annual      return in the previous regime, has now made way for 3 monthly returns and      1 annual return in the GST regime. The jump from 13 to 37 returns in the      year, is a huge increase of compliance activity, which will keep      businesses on their toes on the 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of each month.      Although some of the data is auto populated, time and effort is required      to ensure proper compliance. Needless to say, such a jump in the frequency      in compliance activity cannot be handled by manual accounting systems.</li><li><strong>More      touch-points with the tax consultant</strong>&nbsp;– Similar to the previous indirect tax      regime, businesses may choose to either do compliance in-house or hire the      services of a tax consultant – who could be a CA or a GSTP i.e. GST      practitioner. Given the close scrutiny which is required to be done at the      transaction level for the purpose of compliance, it is a given that      businesses will be sharing their business data more often with the tax      consultant, so that the audits are done properly and returns are filed in      time. Computerised accounts will allow secure sharing if the requisite      business data, which can be viewed by the tax consultant in his system,      reviewed with ease and shared back before the final returns are filed.      Doing this check manually will indeed be extremely difficult.</li></ul>
