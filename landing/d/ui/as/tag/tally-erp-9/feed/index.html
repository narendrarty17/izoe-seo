										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Why is GST such a game-changer here? There are ample benefits a business
stands to get out of computerised accounts, but GST seems to have added a whole
new set of reasons, all by itself. Let’s explore why computerised accounts has
become all the more important, since it can help your business for being
compliant under GST:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Compliance      no longer based on summary, but based on transactions</strong>&nbsp;– In the previous      indirect tax regime, the return filling used to be based on summary level      information i.e. on the total of all transactions in a given financial      period. In the GST regime, each transaction will need to be uploaded on      the GST portal, and via a set of 3 returns, every tax payer will get to      know about his tax liability and the available input tax credit he can      utilise to meet it. Given the multiple suppliers and customers, managing      compliance at this level is next to impossible using manual accounting.      Maintaining computerised accounts will not only allow for accurate book      keeping, but also allow quick detection of errors, and a comprehensive      compliance experience which can ensure the right ITC for businesses.</li><li><strong>Dependency      on supplier for the right ITC</strong>&nbsp;– In the previous indirect tax regime,      there was no inter-dependency amongst businesses as far as compliance was      concerned. In the current regime, the allotment of ITC on provisional      basis and consequently on a final basis is dependent on the suppliers of a      business. Only if the supplier files his returns properly and pays the      requisite tax against those returns, will a business avail the right ITC.      There are bound to be situations, where there may be disputes, missing      invoices etc. and that can only be resolved via a robust system of online      matching of bills. Both pre and post matching, businesses will need to      check their books for any errors or non-compliant transactions, and      correct potential errors. In order to communicate with one’s suppliers and      customers with the right data, maintaining computerised accounts is a      must. Manual accounting will surely make the process longer and tedious,      which may result in loss of ITC and negatively impact working capital.</li><li><strong>Revised      ITC provisions</strong>&nbsp;–      Unlike the previous regime, there are a lot of scenarios, in which a business      can avail ITC. One most important example is the ability to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">avail ITC&nbsp;</a>on indirect expenses,      which has been introduced in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">GST regime</a>, as part of the      “furtherance of business”. Similarly, subject to provisions, businesses      are allowed to carry over transitional ITC from the previous regime, ITC      on capital goods and so on. Only if a business maintains accurate records,      will it be able to file the returns correctly, which will lead to the      right ITC being allocated. It is therefore no surprise, that computerised      accounts will be much more useful compared to manual accounts is      concerned, as it will allow for the right records to be fetched, quickly      and efficiently.</li><li><strong>Increased      compliance activity</strong>&nbsp;– For any regular trader, 1 monthly return and 1 annual      return in the previous regime, has now made way for 3 monthly returns and      1 annual return in the GST regime. The jump from 13 to 37 returns in the      year, is a huge increase of compliance activity, which will keep      businesses on their toes on the 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of each month.      Although some of the data is auto populated, time and effort is required      to ensure proper compliance. Needless to say, such a jump in the frequency      in compliance activity cannot be handled by manual accounting systems.</li><li><strong>More      touch-points with the tax consultant</strong>&nbsp;– Similar to the previous indirect tax      regime, businesses may choose to either do compliance in-house or hire the      services of a tax consultant – who could be a CA or a GSTP i.e. GST      practitioner. Given the close scrutiny which is required to be done at the      transaction level for the purpose of compliance, it is a given that      businesses will be sharing their business data more often with the tax      consultant, so that the audits are done properly and returns are filed in      time. Computerised accounts will allow secure sharing if the requisite      business data, which can be viewed by the tax consultant in his system,      reviewed with ease and shared back before the final returns are filed.      Doing this check manually will indeed be extremely difficult.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Introduction</p>



<p>It is crucial that businesses look to computerize their accounts as well, and the main reason behind the same is GST, which became a reality on the 1<sup>st</sup> of July, 2017. One of the key changes brought about in the GST regime is the transformed face of compliance – which requires every business to declare information at the transaction level, connect online with the GST network, and adhere to the right compliance norms. The biggest motivation for doing so will be the availability of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.absoftindia.com" target="_blank">ITC</a>, which will also require businesses to regularly match their records online with their suppliers. All this calls for maintaining accounts on a computerized system, so that it is easy to maintain and also easy to audit.</p>



<p>Role of the CA</p>



<p>The chartered accountant (CA) community has been one of the major
influencers of businesses since time immemorial. Today, as the ecosystem
demands digitization, and as we have embraced the GST regime, the role of the
CA has become more important than before. We believe, that CAs across the
country should definitely be recommending their clients to switch to computerized
accounts – not only for the client’s good, but for their own good as well.</p>



<p>Reasons why CAs should recommend Computerized Accounts</p>



<p>If we dissect the reasons, why a CA should recommend computerized
accounting to his client, they can be categorized into 2 sections:</p>



<ul><li>Increase
     in clientele or number of clients</li><li>Increase
     in workload per client</li></ul>



<p>Increase in Clientele or Number of Clients</p>



<p>In the previous tax regime, INR 5 – 10 lakh was the threshold limit for
VAT registration in most states; manufacturing units with turnover at or above
INR 1.5 crore attracted excise duty, and service tax was payable by units with
revenue of INR 10 lakh and above on rendering of taxable services. But in the
GST regime, a unified threshold limit of INR 10 lakhs for special category States
and INR 20 lakhs for rest of India will come about – which will bring a huge
number of businesses, especially manufacturers who were enjoying exemptions
earlier into the taxable bracket. In simple words, we will have more number of
businesses appearing the market who had never done compliance before, and will
now need the right support and guidance.</p>



<p>Another case in point would be that with goods and services having a
similar treatment under GST, terms like “Manufacturer”, “Trader” and “Service
Provider” will gradually lose meaning. Similarly, while the previous regime saw
tax experts being classified across to area of expertise – excise, service, VAT
etc. – the current regime will see just one entity – the GST Practitioner
(GSTP), who will be an expert in GST, which subsumes all such indirect taxes.
In other words, the entire market of taxable clients will open up to the entire
community of tax practitioners and CAs, and the one with the better expertise
and knowledge will be able to have the larger clientele.</p>



<p>Increase in Workload per Client</p>



<p>For an individual client also, the workload of the CA will see a massive
increase, due to the following reasons:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Transaction      based compliance</strong> –      In the previous indirect tax regime, the return filling used to be on      summary values of all transactions in a given period. In the GST era, each      transaction need to be uploaded on the GST portal and the portal will      communicate about one’s tax liability and available tax credit. Unless a      client maintains his books of accounts properly, compliance will be      difficult. Not only that, the aspect of online matching of bills, with      your supplier is a crucial activity for tax compliance and ITC, and that      can be done only when accurate transaction based records are maintained.</li><li><strong>Business      will get <a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">input tax credit</a> based on the tax discipline of Supplier</strong> – In the current      scheme of returns filing under GST, it is important that the supplier of a      business, files his returns properly and pays the requisite tax against      those returns – as that will ensure the right ITC being credited to the      business. This is bound to increase the behaviour of maintaining books as      accurately as possible, as ITC has a direct impact on working capital.</li><li><strong>Input      Tax Credit can be availed towards Indirect Expenses</strong> – Under GST, the      “furtherance of business” concept has been introduced wherein businesses      can avail ITC on indirect expenses. Thus, businesses should take care to      maintain records appropriately, such that the right ITC can be claimed.</li><li><strong>37      Returns in a Year</strong> – In the previous regime, service tax warranted a half-yearly      return while VAT was a monthly / quarterly return. But now, 1 monthly      return and 1 annual return in the previous regime, has now made way for 3      monthly returns and 1 annual return in the GST regime. The jump from 13 to      37 returns in the year, is a huge increase of compliance activity. Though      some of the data is auto populated, time and effort is required to ensure      proper compliance.</li><li><strong>Common      Filing Dates for all Clients</strong> – In the previous regime, different      clients (VAT, Service Tax, and Excise) used to have different filling      dates and frequency. In the <a href="http://absoftindia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">GST regime</a>, all clients (VAT, Service      Tax and Excise) of a CA will need to comply with common filling dates. One      can well imagine the increased pressure on a CA on the last date for each      return in a month.</li></ul>



<p>As a result of both these factors, the workload of a CA is bound to
increase many times than before. One can easily say, that managing a client
will become next to impossible, if the client does not have a discipline of
recording each transaction when it happens; in other words invoice level
details have to be maintained accurately and efficiently. The simple solution
is, that CAs should start advocating and educating the client about the need to
develop a practice to record inwards/outwards regularly, so that their own
workload will be reduced, nearing the compliance dates. And the only way, a
CA’s client can do so, is by embracing computerized accounting and technology
to have a seamless compliance experience.</p>

<p><strong>Its definitely not easy to run the
business &#8211; </strong></p>



<p>Running a business is a multi tasking job. Business
owners have to pay attention in each and every department and monitor and
control the activities to get the desired output. </p>



<p>Now imagine manually handling all of
the data available in a non-consolidated format in physical files. It seems so overwhelming
even to think about.</p>



<p>But we are fortunate enough to have
computers so we do not have to deal with physical files for data anymore. Data
in non-consolidated format is still a problem as a lot of time will be spent
first creating a consolidated summary of the data and then analysing it.</p>



<p>To take away this burden from the business owners, <a href="http://www.absoftindia.com">Tally. ERP 9 software </a>has some amazing reports that suit almost every business type. These reports will help you to measure, analyze and implement control measures if needed.</p>



<p>Tally
Reporting System &#8211;</p>



<p><strong>Balance sheet</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<strong>balance
sheet</strong>&nbsp;is a financial statement that reports a company&#8217;s assets,
liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity at a specific point in time, and provides
a basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It shows the financial stability and the performance of the company.</p>



<p><strong>Profit and
loss </strong></p>



<p>Display&nbsp;<strong>Profit</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Loss Account</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Profit
and Loss Account</strong>&nbsp;or Income&nbsp;<strong>Statement</strong>&nbsp;is a
periodic&nbsp;<strong>statement</strong>, which shows the net result of business
operations for a specified period. The&nbsp;<strong>profit and loss account in Tally</strong>.
ERP 9 displays the information based on the default primary groups.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase
register</strong></p>



<p>A purchase register shows a summary
of all the purchases made by the company at a specific period. You can check
for errors or duplicate entries that may generate a false image of the company.</p>



<p><strong>Sales register</strong></p>



<p>A sales register just like the
purchase register shows a summary of all the sales done at a specific period of
time. This helps you to keep a check on the movement of goods out of the
organization. You can get insights about your best sold products.</p>



<p><strong>Stock summary
report</strong></p>



<p>You can check the present condition
of the stock. This helps to understand how to optimally reorder stock without
wasting it. And avoid over-stocking of inventory or under-stocking.</p>



<p><strong>Ratio Analysis</strong></p>



<p>A ratio analysis report is an amazing
tool to understand the financial standing of the company. The different ratios
give a clear understanding of the financial health of the company. Various
ratios like debt-equity ratio, quick ratio, return on working capital, etc. are
available in Tally.</p>



<p>All of this data is considered highly
confidential and you would never want an outsider to get a hold over it and
thus it is important to hide certain data or ensure there is some security in
place for your Tally data.</p>



<p><strong>Security And Control
Features In Tally &#8211;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tally Vault</strong></p>



<p>Tally has a feature of Tally vault.
That keeps data encrypted. Only when you enter a password, the data is
accessible. With the help of this feature, you can ensure your data is not
being accessed by any unauthorized person.</p>



<p><strong>Hide data path</strong></p>



<p>Data path is where your Tally data is
saved. In default Tally, your data path is visible to the user. Some businesses
may see this as a threat to their data and may want to hide the location of
their data. In such businesses, Tally Server 9 can be used to get higher levels
of security.</p>



<p><strong>Data entry
report and log</strong></p>



<p>You can monitor your employee’s
activity using this feature. And ensure efficiency in work is maintained. The
