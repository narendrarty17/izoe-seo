One of the key changes brought about in the GST regime is the transformed face of compliance \u2013 which requires every business to declare information at the transaction level, connect online with the GST network, and adhere to the right compliance norms. The biggest motivation for doing so will be the availability of\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.absoftindia.com\" target=\"_blank\">ITC<\/a>, which will also require businesses to regularly match their records online with their suppliers. All this calls for maintaining accounts on a computerized system, so that it is easy to maintain and also easy to audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Role of the CA<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chartered accountant (CA) community has been one of the major\ninfluencers of businesses since time immemorial. Today, as the ecosystem\ndemands digitization, and as we have embraced the GST regime, the role of the\nCA has become more important than before. We believe, that CAs across the\ncountry should definitely be recommending their clients to switch to computerized\naccounts \u2013 not only for the client\u2019s good, but for their own good as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasons why CAs should recommend Computerized Accounts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we dissect the reasons, why a CA should recommend computerized\naccounting to his client, they can be categorized into 2 sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increase\n     in clientele or number of clients<\/li><li>Increase\n     in workload per client<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase in Clientele or Number of Clients<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous tax regime, INR 5 \u2013 10 lakh was the threshold limit for\nVAT registration in most states; manufacturing units with turnover at or above\nINR 1.5 crore attracted excise duty, and service tax was payable by units with\nrevenue of INR 10 lakh and above on rendering of taxable services. But in the\nGST regime, a unified threshold limit of INR 10 lakhs for special category States\nand INR 20 lakhs for rest of India will come about \u2013 which will bring a huge\nnumber of businesses, especially manufacturers who were enjoying exemptions\nearlier into the taxable bracket. In simple words, we will have more number of\nbusinesses appearing the market who had never done compliance before, and will\nnow need the right support and guidance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another case in point would be that with goods and services having a\nsimilar treatment under GST, terms like \u201cManufacturer\u201d, \u201cTrader\u201d and \u201cService\nProvider\u201d will gradually lose meaning. Similarly, while the previous regime saw\ntax experts being classified across to area of expertise \u2013 excise, service, VAT\netc. \u2013 the current regime will see just one entity \u2013 the GST Practitioner\n(GSTP), who will be an expert in GST, which subsumes all such indirect taxes.\nIn other words, the entire market of taxable clients will open up to the entire\ncommunity of tax practitioners and CAs, and the one with the better expertise\nand knowledge will be able to have the larger clientele.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase in Workload per Client<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an individual client also, the workload of the CA will see a massive\nincrease, due to the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Transaction      based compliance<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013      In the previous indirect tax regime, the return filling used to be on      summary values of all transactions in a given period. In the GST era, each      transaction need to be uploaded on the GST portal and the portal will      communicate about one\u2019s tax liability and available tax credit. Unless a      client maintains his books of accounts properly, compliance will be      difficult. Not only that, the aspect of online matching of bills, with      your supplier is a crucial activity for tax compliance and ITC, and that      can be done only when accurate transaction based records are maintained.<\/li><li><strong>Business      will get <a href=\"http:\/\/www.absoftindia.com\">input tax credit<\/a> based on the tax discipline of Supplier<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 In the current      scheme of returns filing under GST, it is important that the supplier of a      business, files his returns properly and pays the requisite tax against      those returns \u2013 as that will ensure the right ITC being credited to the      business. This is bound to increase the behaviour of maintaining books as      accurately as possible, as ITC has a direct impact on working capital.<\/li><li><strong>Input      Tax Credit can be availed towards Indirect Expenses<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Under GST, the      \u201cfurtherance of business\u201d concept has been introduced wherein businesses      can avail ITC on indirect expenses. Thus, businesses should take care to      maintain records appropriately, such that the right ITC can be claimed.<\/li><li><strong>37      Returns in a Year<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 In the previous regime, service tax warranted a half-yearly      return while VAT was a monthly \/ quarterly return. But now, 1 monthly      return and 1 annual return in the previous regime, has now made way for 3      monthly returns and 1 annual return in the GST regime. The jump from 13 to      37 returns in the year, is a huge increase of compliance activity. Though      some of the data is auto populated, time and effort is required to ensure      proper compliance.<\/li><li><strong>Common      Filing Dates for all Clients<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 In the previous regime, different      clients (VAT, Service Tax, and Excise) used to have different filling      dates and frequency. In the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/absoftindia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">GST regime<\/a>, all clients (VAT, Service      Tax and Excise) of a CA will need to comply with common filling dates. One      can well imagine the increased pressure on a CA on the last date for each      return in a month.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of both these factors, the workload of a CA is bound to\nincrease many times than before. One can easily say, that managing a client\nwill become next to impossible, if the client does not have a discipline of\nrecording each transaction when it happens; in other words invoice level\ndetails have to be maintained accurately and efficiently. The simple solution\nis, that CAs should start advocating and educating the client about the need to\ndevelop a practice to record inwards\/outwards regularly, so that their own\nworkload will be reduced, nearing the compliance dates. And the only way, a\nCA\u2019s client can do so, is by embracing computerized accounting and technology\nto have a seamless compliance experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is crucial that businesses look to computerize their accounts as well, and the main reason behind the same is GST, which became a reality on the 1st of July, 2017.
