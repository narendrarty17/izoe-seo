Business\nowners have to pay attention in each and every department and monitor and\ncontrol the activities to get the desired output. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine manually handling all of\nthe data available in a non-consolidated format in physical files. It seems so overwhelming\neven to think about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we are fortunate enough to have\ncomputers so we do not have to deal with physical files for data anymore. Data\nin non-consolidated format is still a problem as a lot of time will be spent\nfirst creating a consolidated summary of the data and then analysing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take away this burden from the business owners, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.absoftindia.com\">Tally. ERP 9 software <\/a>has some amazing reports that suit almost every business type. These reports will help you to measure, analyze and implement control measures if needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tally\nReporting System &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balance sheet<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>balance\nsheet<\/strong>&nbsp;is a financial statement that reports a company&#8217;s assets,\nliabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity at a specific point in time, and provides\na basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It shows the financial stability and the performance of the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Profit and\nloss <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Display&nbsp;<strong>Profit<\/strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>Loss Account<\/strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Profit\nand Loss Account<\/strong>&nbsp;or Income&nbsp;<strong>Statement<\/strong>&nbsp;is a\nperiodic&nbsp;<strong>statement<\/strong>, which shows the net result of business\noperations for a specified period. The&nbsp;<strong>profit and loss account in Tally<\/strong>.\nERP 9 displays the information based on the default primary groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Purchase\nregister<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A purchase register shows a summary\nof all the purchases made by the company at a specific period. You can check\nfor errors or duplicate entries that may generate a false image of the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sales register<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sales register just like the\npurchase register shows a summary of all the sales done at a specific period of\ntime. This helps you to keep a check on the movement of goods out of the\norganization. You can get insights about your best sold products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stock summary\nreport<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check the present condition\nof the stock. This helps to understand how to optimally reorder stock without\nwasting it. And avoid over-stocking of inventory or under-stocking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ratio Analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A ratio analysis report is an amazing\ntool to understand the financial standing of the company. The different ratios\ngive a clear understanding of the financial health of the company. Various\nratios like debt-equity ratio, quick ratio, return on working capital, etc. are\navailable in Tally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this data is considered highly\nconfidential and you would never want an outsider to get a hold over it and\nthus it is important to hide certain data or ensure there is some security in\nplace for your Tally data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security And Control\nFeatures In Tally &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tally Vault<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tally has a feature of Tally vault.\nThat keeps data encrypted. Only when you enter a password, the data is\naccessible. With the help of this feature, you can ensure your data is not\nbeing accessed by any unauthorized person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hide data path<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data path is where your Tally data is\nsaved. In default Tally, your data path is visible to the user. Some businesses\nmay see this as a threat to their data and may want to hide the location of\ntheir data. In such businesses, Tally Server 9 can be used to get higher levels\nof security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data entry\nreport and log<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can monitor your employee\u2019s\nactivity using this feature. And ensure efficiency in work is maintained. The\nmore you are aware of the day to day activities of your employees the more you\nwill be able to execute control measures to improve their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some very important\nfeatures in Tally that you, as a business owner must be aware of. You can now\naccess your Tally data in graphical format using your Smart phone through Biz\nEye Business Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GET IN TOUCH WITH THE TALLY EXPERTS NOW ! <\/p>\n\n\n<div role=\"form\" class=\"wpcf7\" id=\"wpcf7-f818-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/824#wpcf7-f818-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"818\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"5.4.1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f818-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<p><label> Your Name (required)<br \/>\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-name\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" \/><\/span> <\/label><\/p>\n<p><label> Your Email (required)<br \/>\n    <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-email\"><input type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" \/><\/span> <\/label><\/p>\n<p><label> Your Number (required)<span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap tel-988\"><input type=\"tel\" name=\"tel-988\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-tel wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-tel\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" \/><\/span> <\/label><\/p>\n<p><label> Service Interested In <span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap menu-533\"><select name=\"menu-533[]\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-select wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" multiple=\"multiple\"><option value=\"TallyPrime Software\">TallyPrime Software<\/option><option value=\"TallyPrime Server\">TallyPrime Server<\/option><option value=\"TallyPrime Support Services\">TallyPrime Support Services<\/option><option value=\"TallyPrime AddOns\">TallyPrime AddOns<\/option><option value=\"TallyPrime AMC Services\">TallyPrime AMC Services<\/option><option value=\"TallyPrime Training Services\">TallyPrime Training Services<\/option><\/select><\/span><\/label><\/p>\n<p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-submit\" \/><\/p>\n<input type='hidden' class='wpcf7-pum' value='{\"closepopup\":false,\"closedelay\":0,\"openpopup\":false,\"openpopup_id\":0}' \/><div class=\"wpcf7-response-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/div><\/form><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tally.
