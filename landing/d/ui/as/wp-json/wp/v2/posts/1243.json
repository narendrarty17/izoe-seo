The following are the primary users of accounting information.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internal users:<\/strong>\u00a0Internal users of accounting information are management, employees, Owners etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>External users:<\/strong>\u00a0Regulatory, tax authorities, banks, unions etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in accounting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Generally accepted accounting principles\u2019, commonly known as \u2018GAAP\u2019, sets the protocol for summarizing and preparing the financial statements.
